     <p> 
        I was born in and raised in Orlando Florida with a heavy emphasis on the importance of Family and community.  I attended several private schools from the ages five to eighteen until my graduation from Bishop Moore Catholic Highschool in the fall of 2012. During my Highs School career, I accumulated over 200+ hours, outside of the classroom, in volunteer work. I developed a passion for helping others and giving back to the community. While attending my last semester at Seminole State College I found myself working the front desk of a local Nursing and Rehabilitation center. In under two years’ time I had become not only the youngest employee, but the youngest department manager. The time spent with patients and their family was invaluable and rewarding, but with no career options and a child on the way I chose to leave the company in pursuit of a different path.

     <p>I’ve currently be with FIS since October of 2016, as a General Service Associate II in the Facilities Operations Department. The company itself has some of the most intelligent hardworking and successful people I have ever been in the presence of and has made me want to strive for a higher position within the corporation. For that reason, I am currently enrolled in The University of Central Florida’s Coding Bootcamp. My hopes are to obtain the proper skills needed to become a full-stack developer and better provide for my family.
